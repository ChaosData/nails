- general cleanup
- sessions
  - cookie_store
  - redis
    - probably just gonna use hiredis
- DB layer
  - pooling
  - should allow request handlers to get a connection
    - will likely need mutex on the thing that hands them out
  - need to verify worker cloning situation
    - don't want separate worker processes sharing connections
      - will possibly need to init connections in connection manager during
        request handling
- assess potential for async

  - would likely use libuv; it's treated me fairly well in the past
  - would need to modify:
    - body parsing
    - DB stuff
    - redis stuff
